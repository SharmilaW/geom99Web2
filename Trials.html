    <!-- The main content of this page includes a general overview of the skills and knowledge we gained from taking our web design class, plus another section to exhibit examples of our web design skills. Each 
	 subsection is under a separate div, then subdivided further using paragraph tags for readability purposes. -->

            <h2>Web Design and Programming</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p> 
                Web design has been a key component of our studies at Fleming College this year. We began by learning the fundamentals of how the internet works, including basic concepts like what ping is, how HTTP 
		functions, client-server relationships, and URL encoding. Soon afterwards, we moved on to HTML and CSS, which we spent several weeks becoming familiar with. We learned how to use them to define the 
		content of a website, then modify that content in order to create a visually interesting and user-friendly design for any given website. Once we had a significant grasp of those two fundamental 
		languages, we began to learn how to use Javascript to create more dynamic websites with a greater degree of interactivity.
            </p>
        </div>
	<!-- I decided to use this section to show off a few elements that some of our group members integrated into their own personal websites. I used screenshots in order to highlight specific parts of their pages. -->
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Assignment 2: Personal Website</h3>
            <p> 
		As a part of our program of study, we were each asked to create an individual website in order to exhibit the HTML, CSS, and general web design skills that we had learned in the course up to 
		that point. Each site was required to contain at least two pages of content and was intended to serve as a personal resume. Since this was an individual assignment, each team member produced a unique final 
		product. This section will exhibit points of interest from various team members' websites.
            </p>
	    <!-- I have used standard image tags to link this image and two others that are stored in the /img subfolder. Each has recieved a CSS ID to set it to its native resolution and set resize parameters for
		 responsive design purposes. -->
	    <img src="img/tylerwebsite.png" alt="The education table on Tyler's website" id="wd1">
	    <!-- Each image on this page has received a caption, which is centred below the image and made into a slightly smaller font using a CSS class -->
            <p class="caption"> 
		Tyler's website included a table communicating his educational achievements. He assigned a unique ID to each row, then used CSS to create a mouse-over effect that turned the background and text into the 
		school's colours.
            </p>
	    <img src="img/luxwebsite.png" alt="The navbar on Thiluxsaan's website" id="wd2">	
	    <p class="caption">
		Thiluxsaan's website included a navigation bar which appeared at the top right of every page. It was attractive, well-aligned, and used CSS to change colours to a white background upon mouse-over.
	    </p>
	    <img src="img/jacksonwebsite.png" alt="The navbar on Jackson's website" id="wd3">
	    <p class="caption">
		Jackson's website included a navigation bar which appeared at the top left of every page. Each link gained a gray background upon mouse-over, and in addition, the top two links turned orange depending 
		on which of the pages the user was on.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		This project provided us with valuable hands-on experience in website design. It taught us how to design professional websites that will allow us (or any company we represent) to present our best possible 
		face to the general public. In the modern era, having no web presence is almost the same as being invisible in a business sense, so having these skills could well prove vital in terms of gaining clients 
		and networking within the GIS industry. Having completed this set of websites, we are much more confident in our ability to work in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and we look forward to using those languages 
		to implement solutions for future employers and clients.
